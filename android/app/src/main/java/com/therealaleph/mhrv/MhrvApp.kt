/**
 * Application-level setup. The only job here right now is to catch
 * uncaught JVM exceptions and route them through logcat under the
 * `mhrv-crash` tag BEFORE the process dies. Without this the crashes
 * appear as opaque "App closed unexpectedly" with no line number in
 * `adb logcat` — we re-raise the exception afterwards so the default
 * handler still prints its stack trace and Android still shows the
 * dialog, but at least the chain-of-events is searchable.
 *
 * Registering the handler in `Application.onCreate()` (rather than
 * `Activity.onCreate()`) catches crashes on ALL process threads,
 * including the tun2proxy worker and the log-drain coroutine —
 * important because those don't have an activity in scope.
