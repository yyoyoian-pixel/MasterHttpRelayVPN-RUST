#
# Multi-stage build for the mhrv-tunnel-node service.
#
# Build stage compiles a release binary against rust 1.85 (matches MSRV in
# Cargo.toml). Cargo's incremental build cache is mounted via BuildKit
# `--mount=type=cache` so a `docker build` against an unchanged dependency
# tree skips re-downloading + re-compiling crates — first build ~6 min,
# warm builds ~30 s.
#
# Runtime stage is `debian:bookworm-slim` for libc compatibility (the
# binary dynamically links against glibc) plus `ca-certificates` so HTTPS
# upstream URLs from `data` ops can do TLS handshake. Image stays under
# 100 MB end-to-end.
#
# Runs as a dedicated non-root `tunnel` user (uid 1000) — the service
# never needs to write outside its own process state, so no reason to
# give it root.
#
# Required env vars:
#   TUNNEL_AUTH_KEY   shared secret matching `const TUNNEL_AUTH_KEY` in
#                     CodeFull.gs. The service refuses every request
#                     without a matching key.
#   PORT              HTTP listen port. Defaults to 8080 if unset.
#
# Health: the service responds to `GET /` with a small status JSON. Add
# `--health-cmd 'curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/ || exit 1'` on the
# `docker run` if you want compose-level health gating.

# BuildKit cache mounts: cargo's registry/git caches and the target/
# directory persist across builds, dramatically speeding up rebuilds when
# only application code changes.
#
# `id=...-$TARGETPLATFORM` is load-bearing on multi-arch builds. Without
# it, BuildKit defaults to a single shared cache across architectures
# and the `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` jobs race on the same on-disk
# `/usr/local/cargo/registry/src/.../<crate>/.cargo-ok` extraction. The
# second-arriving arch hits `File exists (os error 17)` mid-unpack and
# the whole multi-arch build fails. Per-platform cache id keeps each
# arch's cache isolated; warm-build speedup is preserved per-arch.
# `target` cache is also platform-scoped because target/ holds object
# files for one ABI and sharing them across arches would just produce
# misses or, worse, invalid linking.
