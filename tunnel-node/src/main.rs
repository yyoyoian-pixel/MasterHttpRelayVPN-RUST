//! HTTP Tunnel Node for MasterHttpRelayVPN "full" mode.
//!
//! Bridges HTTP tunnel requests (from Apps Script) to real TCP connections.
//! Supports both single-op (`POST /tunnel`) and batch (`POST /tunnel/batch`)
//! modes. Batch mode processes all active sessions in one HTTP round trip,
//! dramatically reducing the number of Apps Script calls.
//!
//! Env vars:
//!   TUNNEL_AUTH_KEY — shared secret (required)
//!   PORT           — listen port (default 8080, Cloud Run sets this)
