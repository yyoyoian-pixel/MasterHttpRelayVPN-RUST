//! Opens a TLS connection to the configured Google IP while the TLS SNI is set
//! to `front_domain` (e.g. "www.google.com"). Inside the encrypted stream, HTTP
//! `Host` points to `script.google.com`, and we POST a JSON payload to
//! `/macros/s/{script_id}/exec`. Apps Script performs the actual upstream
//! HTTP fetch server-side and returns a JSON envelope.
//!
//! Multiplexes over HTTP/2 when the relay edge agrees via ALPN; falls back
//! to HTTP/1.1 keep-alive when h2 is refused or fails. Range-parallel
//! downloads are implemented by `relay_parallel_range_to` (writer-based,
